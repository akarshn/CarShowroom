    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">REFERENCE</a>
    <p>The<b>chicken</b>(Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl, with attributes of wild
        species</p>
    <P>
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas,
        Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor,
        and to Greece by the 5th century BC.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken was originally a term only for an immature,
        or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its usage on restaurant menus,
        it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English.
        In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[22]

        Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs,
        but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
        A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken
        breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[33]
